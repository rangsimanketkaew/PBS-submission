          A Suite of PBS Pro Script Generator for Interactive Job Submission on TAIWANIA Cluster


=============
SOFTWARE INFO
=============

This is the second release of the PBS Pro script generator for interactive job submission of computational 
chemistry calculation on TAIWANIA (PETA) cluster, National Center for High-Performance Computing, Taiwan. 
TAIWANIA cluster is Intel Xeon Gold 6148 cluster equiped with the Intel Omni-Path high-speed interconnect.
Source code customization is needed for other workload managers and HPC clusters.

========
FEATURES
========

1. Interactive job submission.
2. Automatic job queue recognition.
3. Shared and distributed memory parallel processing.
4. GPU accelerator are supported.

================
PARALLEL METHODS
================

1. Message Passing Interface (MPI) Parallel method.
2. Shared-Memory Parallel method (SMP).
3. Hybrid Parallel method for multiprocessor/multinode cluster (on request).

==========
COMPONENTS
==========

This software suite contains the PBS Pro script generator of several quantum chemistry programs:

  1. subg09      Gaussian 09
  3. subg16      Gaussian 16
  4. subnwchem   NWChem
  5. subnwmult   NWChem (multiple jobs)
  6. subqchem    Q-Chem
  7. suborca     ORCA
  8. subgms      GAMESS (OpenMP protocol)
  9. subgmsmpi   GAMESS (MPI protocol)
 10. sublmp      LAMMPS (CPU)
 11. submolpro   Molpro
