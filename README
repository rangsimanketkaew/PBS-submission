                                                 ==================                                  

      An Open Source Collection of Program for Interactive Submission of Computational Chemistry Calculation 
  on PBS Job Scheduler of TAIWANIA (PETA) Cluster, National Center for High-Performance Computing (NCHC), Taiwan.

=============
SOFTWARE INFO
=============

This is an open source collection of program for interactive submission of computational chemistry calculation 
on TAIWANIA* (PETA) cluster, National Center for High-Performance Computing (NCHC), Taiwan.

*TAIWANIA cluster is Intel Xeon Gold 6148 cluster equiped with the Intel Omni-Path high-speed interconnect.

===========
APPLICATION
===========

QM-on-TAIWANIA is obviously designed for PBS Professional workload manager.
Hence, source code customization is needed for other workload managers and HPC clusters.

========
FEATURES
========

1. Interactive job submission.
2. Automatic job queue recognition.
3. Shared and distributed memory parallel processing.
4. GPU accelerator are supported.

================
PARALLEL METHODS
================

1. Message Passing Interface (MPI) Parallel method.
2. Shared-Memory Parallel method (SMP).
3. Hybrid parallel method for multiprocessor/multinode cluster (MPI+SMP).

==========
COMPONENTS
==========

This software suite contains a growing variety of several quantum chemistry program.

PROGRAM MANUAL
==============

Each sub-program has built-in manual, which can be opened by using "-help" option.

Normal usages of all sub-program are also available at https://github.com/rangsimanketkaew/QM-on-TAIWANIA/

===========
DISCLAIMERS
===========

1. I do not take any responsibility if any damage or failure cuased through use of all programs.
2. All programs were written in C-shell and tested during in stage open beta testing.
