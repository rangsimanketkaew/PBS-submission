          A Suite of PBS Pro Script Generator for Interactive Job Submission on TAIWANIA Cluster
          --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------
This is the first release of the automatic generator of PBS Pro script for interactive job submission
of chemistry application on TAIWANIA cluster, National Center for High-Performance Computing, Taiwan.
TAIWANIA is Intel Xeon Gold 6148 cluster equiped with the Intel Omni-Path high-speed interconnect.
The source code of all programs were written in C-shell, and tested during in stage open beta testing. 
Source code customization is needed for other workload manager and for other HPC cluster.

  1. subg09      Gaussian 09
  3. subg16      Gaussian 16
  4. subnwchem   NWChem
  5. subnwmult   NWChem (multiple jobs)
  6. subqchem    Q-Chem
  7. suborca     ORCA
  8. subgms      GAMESS (OpenMP protocol)
  9. subgmsmpi   GAMESS (MPI protocol)
